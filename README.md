# jQuery-clickToClickMove-demo

This is a codebase for a demo of reordering items in a list using clickable / touchable targets instead of dragging and
dropping items.

This demo was originally created back in March 2008 and hosted on a personal web server with a database that provided the
ability to add list items and to persist changes.  It was ported here to GitHub to preserve it as inspiration for other 
developers, and the data for the demo is now provided via Jekyll data files.

The working demo is available here:  https://bcswartz.github.io/jQuery-clickToClickMove-demo/
